# Project Title: Triple Espresso

## Overview

Triple Espresso is a website developed to showcase the offerings of a coffee shop and provide information to customers. The project focuses on creating a web page using HTML, CSS, and the BEM methodology. Each phase builds upon the previous one, culminating in a fully functional and styled web page.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

In this phase, the focus was on setting up the initial structure of the project. The tasks included:

- Creating the repository and setting up the initial file structure.
- Linking necessary fonts using Google Fonts.
- Adding metadata to the HTML `<head>` section.
- Describing the main blocks of the web page.
- Configuring the fonts and verifying their correct linkage.

### Phase 2: Creating the Website Layout

In this phase, the focus was on designing the initial layout of the website. The tasks included:

- Creating the header and the "Recipes" section.
- Using Flexbox and positioning techniques.
- Embedding YouTube videos into the page.

### Phase 3: Adding a Form

In this phase, the focus was on adding a form to the website. The tasks included:

- Creating a reservation form for booking a table at the coffee shop.
- Styling the form using CSS.

### Phase 4: Final Stage

In this phase, the final touches were added to the project. The tasks included:

- Refactoring the CSS to use a flat BEM file structure.
- Adding the footer to the web page.
- Ensuring all styles are correctly imported and linked.
